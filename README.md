# CsvDataSplitter
A opinionated Windows Forms application for splitting big data CSV files.

## Project Charter
This project was motivated by the following: 
-	I need to split big data CSV files at work.
-	I need to give my coworkers the ability to split big data csv without the trials and tribulations of sharing randomly revised, uncontrolled, codes and scripts.
-	Benchmarking a simple async file operation application would be a good learning experience and deeper dive into IO.
-	The project closest to this application is missing a few features essential to me.
-	A user interface is required.
-	At this time, no open-source application can fulfill all requirements.
-	The programmers on Twitter said to be a builder you must build.
